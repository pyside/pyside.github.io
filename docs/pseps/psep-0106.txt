Abstract
========

This PSEP describes a new module to access internal information related
to our binding technology. Access to this internal information is
required to e.g.: integrate PySide with Qt based programs that offer
Python scripting like |maya| or just for debug purposes.

Rationale
=========

When developing Python bindings for native libraries, information about
the internal state of a Python object is commonly needed. A separate
module with functions to query this information can help creating
better unit tests. In addition to the debugging context, access to the
internal state of Python objects may be needed to integrate Shiboken-based
bindings with other technologies such as |maya| or other software using
Qt and Python.


Description of the Shiboken module
==================================

The Python module named "shiboken" will offer the following functions:

Some function descriptions refer to "Shiboken based objects" which mean
Python object instances of any Python type created using Shiboken.

``isValid(obj)``

    Given a Python object, returns True if the object methods can be called
    without an exception being thrown. A Python wrapper becomes invalid when
    the underlying C++ object is destroyed or unreachable.

``invalidate(obj)``

    Mark the object as invalid, so the underlying C++ object will not be
    destroyed by Shiboken and any use of this object will raise an exception.

``wrapInstance(address, type)``

    Creates a Python wrapper for a C++ object instantiated at a given memory
    address - the returned object type will be the same given by the user.

    The type must be a Shiboken type, the C++ object will not be
    destroyed when the returned Python object reach zero references.

    If the address is invalid or does not point to a C++ object of given type,
    use of the wrapped object may result in a segmentation fault or other
    undefined behaviour.

``getCppPointer(obj)``

    Returns a tuple of longs that contain the memory addresses of the
    C++ instances wrapped by the given object.

``delete(obj)``

    Deletes the C++ object wrapped by the given Python object.

``ownedByPython(obj)``

    Given a Python object, returns True if Python is responsible for deleting
    the underlying C++ object, False otherwise.

    If the object was not a Shiboken based object, a TypeError is
    thrown.

``createdByPython(obj)``

    Returns true if the given Python object was created by Python.

``dump(obj)``

    Returns a string with implementation-defined information about the
    object.
    This method should be used **only** for debug purposes by developers
    creating their own bindings as no guarantee is provided that
    the string format will be the same across different versions.

    If the object is not a Shiboken based object, a TypeError is thrown.

``__version__``

    String with Shiboken version.

``__version_info__``

    A tuple containing the five components of the version number: major,
    minor, micro, releaselevel, and serial.

Discussion
==========

Carlo Giesa wanted to do some integration of PySide with |maya| [#maya]_
and noticed that PySide doesn't have anything equivalent to PyQt4
``sip.wrapinstance()``.

David Martínez Martí filed a feature request [#bug536]_ for a function to
return True or False if an object still valid or not.

Thomas Perl filed feature request [#bug902]_ summarizing some
functions that should appear in a helper module.

Sebastian Wiesner requested to have an inverse of ``wrapInstance(type,
address)`` to be able to pass PySide-created objects to native Qt
libraries.

Matti Airas suggested that a review of PyQt's ``sip`` module should be
made and all relevant methods from there added to this PSEP.
